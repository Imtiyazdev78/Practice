1. How to configure git Profile 
     git config --global user.name "XYZ"
     git config --global user.email "XYZ@XYZ.com"

     => To check configure command 
          git config --list


===> Normal Basic Command 
        mkdir Folder_name -> To create new folder
        cd     -> Change directory
        ls     -> List directory
        ls -a  -> To check all hidden file 
        clone  -> To clone a repo.. on our loacal machine = git clone "url"
        status -> To check the state of the code 



2. Four type of status
        1. Untracked:- new files that git doesn't ye track
        2. Modified:   files that have been changed but not commited
        3. Staged:     files that have been changed and ready to be commited
        4. unmodified: unchanged 


3. Add & Commit 
   add    --> adds new or change files in our working directory
   commit --> It keeps record of changes 
              Ex: git commit -m "First"



4. To Change Branch Name --> git branch -M main
   To Check Branch Name  --> git branch
   git push -u origin main --> -u means to set upstream 

   Now we can use only  --> git push 


==> git checkout is used to switch branches or check specific files


5. Git Branches:
      1. git branch  --> To check branch
      2. git branch -M main 'new branch Name' --> To rename branch
      
      3. git checkout <-branch name->  (To navigate)
            Ex1: git checkout dev

      4. git checkout -b <-new branch name-> (To create new branch)
            Ex1: git checkout -b feature1
            Ex2: git checkout -b feature2

      5. git branch -d <-branch name -> (To delete the branch)
            Ex1: git branch -d feature1
